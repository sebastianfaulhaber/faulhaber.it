In my article “[Five lessons learned on leadership in an Open Organization][open-leadership]” I described my personal journey of moving into my first people management role at [Red Hat][redhat]. I also shared some of my best practices around leadership and approaches towards making a team successful in an Open Organization. Back then, I could not believe I would get harshly kicked out of my personal comfort zone so soon. Before I go there let me add some context. In the beginning of 2021 my team grew from seven to twelve members. This effectively meant that I needed to significantly decrease my time invested in making my associates successful. Then in April a colleague became sick and I was asked to take over the responsibility of another team with a rather different profile. And finally this team’s responsibilities had changed over the course of the year and were therefore mostly unclear.

# The most challenging period in my career
I soon realised that I was in the middle of the most challenging period in my career as a leader:

* 19 team members deserving my time and dedication
* Two teams with different responsibilities and characteristics
* Massive uncertainty and many decisions avoided
* It seemed impossible to complete all of my daily work in the high quality it deserved

Now that I write this article the most challenging five months of my career as a leader applying [Open Management principles][open-org] are behind me. I can confidently say that I successfully got through this period. Moreover, stepping out of my comfort zone really made me grow personally. This is why I am proud to share my learnings and essential tips which helped guide me and allowed me to grow.

# These tips help you to deal with challenging periods in your career

## #1 Preparing for the challenge

* Try to see change and the resulting challenges in a positive way (try to develop a so called [growth mindset][growth])
* When taking new assignments, make the impact of the additional work transparent
* Layout a plan for yourself and reflect under which conditions things could work out
* Take time to reflect on the upcoming change and sleep a night or two on it. Simply don’t rush your decision!
* Take a conscious and timely (!) decision: either accept the challenge or seek an alternative option

## #2 Setting the right expectations
* Challenging situations require setting expectations right and being honest to yourself and others
* Communicate and manage expectation towards yourself, your management (= upwards), and your associates (= downwards)
* Openly address your doubts, weaknesses and obstacles you foresee
* Be clear & honest about what can be achieved, which risks are on the horizon and which outcomes seem impossible

## #3 Getting things started
*Challenging situations often mean that you have a crowded agenda; effectively this translates into having less time for even more tasks.
* Crucially prioritise every item on your agenda and concentrate on first things first
* Focus only on things that “[will make the boat go faster][boat]”
* Learn to say “no” = delete (!) unnecessary items from your agenda and cancel (!) appointments to gain focus time
* Consider delegating even important items to team members you trust
* Understand the impact of [Parkinson’s Law][parkinson] on your behaviour: “Work contracts to fit in the time we give it.”
* Layout a plan with your key action items and rigorously execute against it; what is not on your list, simply does not exist!

## #4 Keep managing
* Adhere to the “You cannot manage what you cannot measure” principle; build your own measurement system to keep track of the progress (e.g. via milestone plans, an executive summary slidedeck e.g.).
* Define the expected outcome from your team clearly and explain the surrounding  conditions 
* Provide broad guide rails towards your team and trust them in [taking (the right) decisions][open-leadership]
* Hold regular conversations with your team and stakeholders to update them on the progress
* Accept you cannot take care of everything, since you simply don’t have enough time. It is ok when some things fail!
* Maintain a positive attitude to the situation and always keep a smile on your face (though it might be difficult sometimes ???? )

## #5 Take care of yourself
* Challenging periods in your career can create (negative) stress and effectively move you into your personal danger zone
* Staying in the danger zone for some time pushes your own boundaries and provides the opportunity to learn and grow
* Maintain a healthy balance between your professional and personal life
* Stick to your personal habits & routines and keep them as the highest priority: spend time on things you love, such as your hobbies and your family!
* Do your favourite sport regularly. If you feel like you don’t have enough time, then you MUST remove things from your business agenda
* Don’t stay in the danger zone for too long, since it can have a severe impact on mental health
Consider your health as the priority number ONE. ALWAYS


# What you should take away
During my time at the German Army one of my instructors kept telling us something that really sticked in my mind: “You cannot imagine what your body is capable of, if you just want to accomplish something”. While he was mainly referring to physical aspects, I think there also lies a lot of truth in this statement regarding challenging periods in business. And of course also relating to my personal situation described above. 

Now that I have been constantly applying these principles described above for the past couple of months, I can conclude that they really helped me to come out of this stressful period a lot stronger than before I went in. In this regard I observed that taking a conscious decision really feels good; while the uncertainty before just creates negative feelings. On top of that I soon realised that my work brought things forward. I knew that I could not save the world in one day. Instead I felt extremely happy and grateful for each small step my team and I went forward. Moreover I have to confess that the situation which appeared so challenging in the beginning, finally started to feel like business as usual.

Overall I can only encourage you to take challenges in your personal career with a positive mindset. Each of them is a unique opportunity for you to grow!
